awk joins json!
===============

as a big fan of `awk` to do quick investigation i was a bit lost when we
switched to json. we have a json record per line, millions of lines a day - a
proper challange for a unix tool like awk if only awk could use the names
instead of the field positions.

First idea was to use the names instead of number. We have records like:

	`{"abc":"3","xyz":"foo"}`

and the code would then look like:

	`{print abc, xyz}`

but to stick with the awk pattern i just put the values (3, foo in our example)
in their numbered slots (1, 2) as always but create variables (abc, xyz) with
the index values (1, 2). so now you can write:

	`{print $abc, $xyz}`

which looks similar nice and is just a minor hack (less than 50 lines code).
the whole thing has it's drawbacks (the json overwrites vars in the code) and
is limited to the pattern 'a json per line' but this is acceptable for my
usecase (we write exactly that kind of file, i control the variable names in
json and awk).

Usage
=====

The feature is off by default and must be enabled by the commandline option
`-j`.

Bugs
====

There is a bug where jawk issues the error:

```
./jawk: illegal field $(), name "abc"
 input record number 1, file
 source line number 1
```

it can be avoided by accessing number fields once (i.e. by having a `$1{}` in
the beginning of the program).
